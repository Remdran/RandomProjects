☐ Style the page
☐ Handle querying the api a different way if the user doesnt want to use geoloc
☐ Make sure the icons match up to all the possible weather types the api can return
☐ Potentially add a background image that changes depending on the weather and possibly the time of day?
☐ Add Temperature
    ☐ Let the user change between celsius and fahrenheit
☐ Add a little more weather information, wind speed etc anything relevant really
